Here, Dr. Kalam presents his dream of schools in India at 2020 as symbiotic nerve centres connecting teachers, students and community; personifying knowledge that exists in the world.He also makes a clarion call to accelerate the process of societal transformation.This would involve raising the standards of governance and safeguarding the sanctity of public institutions. The book uses the metaphor of a tree to describe the process of knowledge bearing fruits of prosperity in the contemporary globalised world where different phases, formative, adult working life, and post-50 experienced senior citizens, call for different kinds of learning.The book refers to a contextual contribution of a large number of Indian scientists and artists and proves that there is no age bar to blossom.He advocates creation of conditions that favour growth of diverse individual talents akin to a g      arden and calls for a scientific mind-set guided by conscience, consensus and by actions that take our social and moral values into account in building our own systems. The book extensively draws from the world literature making an essential inspirational reading.",

And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. How to manage money, invest it, and make business decisions are typically considered to involve a lot of mathematical calculations, where data and formulae tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world, people don?t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. In the psychology of money, the author shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life?s most important matters.",
